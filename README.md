🌐 **New Project Alert: Simple HTML Page Hosted on AWS S3!**

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm excited to share my latest project where I created and hosted a simple HTML page with an image on Amazon S3 as a static website. 🎉

### Project Highlights:

1. **HTML** : Designed a minimalistic HTML page to showcase a beautiful image.
2. **Amazon S3**: Leveraged Amazon S3's static website hosting feature to make the page publicly accessible.
3. **Bucket Policy**: Configured the S3 bucket policy to ensure the website is secure yet accessible to everyone.

### What I Learned:

- How to create and style a basic HTML page.
- Setting up an Amazon S3 bucket for static website hosting.
- Configuring bucket policies to manage access and permissions.

### Why This Matters:

Hosting static websites on Amazon S3 is an efficient and cost-effective way to deploy simple web pages. This project demonstrates my ability to use cloud services to deliver web content swiftly and securely.
